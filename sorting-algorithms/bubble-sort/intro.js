BUBBLE SORT ALGORITHM O(n)
==========================

Algorithm
---------
Binary Search is a much faster from of searching in which instead of checking for values one by one and then eliminating one value each time we can effectively eliminate half of the values at a time and make our search steps much shorter and faster.

******** IMPORTANT ********
Binary Search only works on data which is sorted, in terms of numbers it should be from lowest to highest and for alphabets they should be in acending order  'A' -> 'Z', that means in our search function we should accpet only sorted array or strings or sort them in order ourselves first.

Explanation
------------
We have the following sorted Array :-
