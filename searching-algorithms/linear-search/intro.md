# LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM O(n)

## Algorithm

Linear Search is most commonly used to loop over an array and find a given value in the array and return either true or the index position of that value. All of the Built in JavaScript array methonds like find, indexOf, includes use Linear Search. The most **Important** part about linear search is that our array does not have to be **sorted** for it to work.

It has an O(n) time complexity since in the worst possible case the value we are looking for is located at the very end of the array and we have to loop over the entire array to find that value.
